### WebTorrent.app - Streaming bittorrent client for OS X, Windows, and Linux

Note: this app is a very early work in progress. It is a node-webkit angularjs application built off of [webtorrent](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent).

Please see the list of [issues](https://github.com/feross/webtorrent.app/issues) tracking for project status. Contributions are very welcome :)

### Building

Install bower (web package manager), gulp (build system), and nodewebkit (only necessary for debug, non-release builds). Note that you do not need to install grunt; the Gruntfile exists strictly as an internal workaround for building the node-webkit app.

```
npm install -g bower gulp nodewebkit
```

Initialize dependencies.

```
npm install
bower install
```

Compile local distribution.

```
gulp
```

You can now run `npm start` to run the local version of the app (which runs `nodewebkit dist` under the hood). This is mainly used for debugging during development.

To build release distributions, run

```
gulp nodewebkit
```

This will build executables for Windows, Mac OS, 32-bit Linux, and 64-bit Linux under `build/releases/webtorrent`.
